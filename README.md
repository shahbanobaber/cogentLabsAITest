# Shahbano Baber - Cogent LABS AI Tasks

This repository contains a two Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrates the use of LangChain and the LLAMA 3 language model. The notebook leverages several technologies, including:

- **LLAMA 3 (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)**: A large language model developed by Meta AI, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.
- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications with large language models, providing a modular and extensible approach.
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: A popular library for working with state-of-the-art pretrained models, including LLAMA 3.
- **PyTorch**: A widely-used open-source machine learning library for building and training neural networks.

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Upload the notebook to Kaggle.
2. On Kaggle, create a new notebook instance and select the `T4x2` GPU accelerator.
3. Execute the notebook cells in order.

Note: The notebook assumes the availability of a GPU accelerator for optimal performance. If you encounter any issues or have specific hardware requirements, please refer to the official Kaggle documentation.
